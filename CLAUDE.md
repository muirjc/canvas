# canvas Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: 2026-07-29

## Active Technologies
- No new technology added in 005-modern-ui-redesign — a frontend-only visual redesign in
  `apps/web`. Zero runtime dependencies added: plain global CSS with custom properties, the
  native `<dialog>` element, and inline SVG icons. No persistence, schema, or API change.
- Vercel AI SDK (`ai`, `@ai-sdk/anthropic`, `@ai-sdk/openai`) added in 004-ai-diagram-chat,
  `apps/api` only — provider-configurable via env var, tool-calling against `diagram-core`'s
  model operations. One additive Postgres migration (`ai_personas`, `diagram_chats`,
  `chat_messages`, `ai_settings`); no new workspace/package.
- No new technology added in 003-parser-correctness-fixes — it extends `packages/diagram-core`
  only (no new package, no persistence/schema changes; every new model field is optional and
  reuses the existing `DiagramContainer`/`DiagramEdge`/`DiagramNode` entities).
- TypeScript 5.x end-to-end: React frontend, Fastify backend, Node.js 22 LTS. Shared
  `diagram-core` package (Mermaid DSL parser/serializer/validator) used identically by frontend
  and backend. PostgreSQL + a blob store for icon/shape library assets. (001-diagramming-platform)
- No new technology added in 002-editing-lifecycle-enhancements — it extends the same stack
  (one additive Postgres migration for diagram soft-delete; no new packages/services).
- No new technology added in 006-authoring-admin-console — zero runtime dependencies added. One
  additive Postgres migration on `standards` (`name`, `description`, `retired_at`) plus a backfill;
  seven new pure container operations in `packages/diagram-core`.
- No new technology added in 007-project-context — zero runtime dependencies added. One additive
  Postgres migration on `projects` (`owner_id`) plus a backfill; no new package or service.
- No new technology added in 008-shared-diagram-access — zero runtime dependencies added. One
  additive Postgres migration, index-only (`share_grants_grantee_idx` on `share_grants`); no new
  table, column, package, or service.

## Project Structure

```text
apps/web/src/{canvas,palette,standards,admin,projects,app}   # frontend
apps/api/src/{diagrams,standards,libraries,projects,sharing,admin,export,auth}  # backend
packages/diagram-core/src/{model,dsl,standards,libraries}    # shared parser/serializer/validator
```

## Commands

npm run test --workspace=@canvas/diagram-core && npm run test --workspace=@canvas/api && npm run test --workspace=@canvas/web

## Code Style

TypeScript, standard conventions. `diagram-core` round-trip and standards-validation contract
tests are NON-NEGOTIABLE and must exist (and fail) before implementing any diagram-type or export
work — see `.specify/memory/constitution.md` Principle IV.

## Recent Changes
- 008-shared-diagram-access: A user granted access to a diagram, but not the project containing
  it, previously had no way to discover or reach it, and the home screen actively told them they
  had no work. Adds one self-scoped read endpoint listing a user's direct diagram-level grants and
  a home-screen section rendering it; access resolution (`resolveDiagramAccess`) is unchanged —
  this closes a discovery gap deliberately left open by feature 007's access-control fix, not a
  new access rule.
- 007-project-context: The project a user works in becomes real application state with an
  in-app chooser, instead of a query parameter the UI read but never wrote (landing on the root
  and clicking New Diagram failed outright). Projects gain an `owner_id`, and project visibility
  becomes access-controlled — closing a pre-existing hole where any signed-in user could read any
  project's entire diagram tree by id, since no route taking a project id checked more than
  authentication.
- 006-authoring-admin-console: Containers become first-class canvas objects (create, name, move,
  resize, drag membership; deleting one releases its shapes) backed by seven new `diagram-core`
  operations; a shared admin shell centres every admin screen and adds persistent navigation; a
  visible affordance for the existing label editor; standards gain a name, description and
  retirement date; version history is capped at five with search.
  stylesheet at all. Adds a global CSS token layer, restructures the diagram editor into a
  document bar plus a palette rail and a tabbed secondary rail (DSL/Chat/Issues/History),
  converts dialogs to native modals, and defines empty/loading/error states. Diagram element
  rendering and the export renderer are deliberately untouched; admin screens inherit
  bare-element styling without being edited.
  author "AI personas" (name, architect-category tag, system prompt); users pick one to generate
  a diagram via natural language, then keep refining it through a persistent in-editor chat panel
  that applies targeted `diagram-core` operations (new `addNode`/`addEdge`) rather than
  regenerating the whole diagram.
  a hard defect — only plain `--` worked); ER diagrams support attribute blocks (`{ type name
  PK/FK/UK }`); sequence diagrams support notes and nestable control-flow blocks (`loop`/`alt`/
  `opt`/`par`/`critical`/`break`); and `%%` comments are now honored in every parser, not just
  flowchart's.
  deletion (with confirmation), diagram soft-delete + admin restore, and flowchart parser
  extensions (`graph` header alias, `style` directive, `%%` comments).
  for a governed, multi-persona (Business/Enterprise/Solution/Technical Architect) diagramming
  platform with Mermaid DSL/SVG/PNG export and Azure/AWS icon libraries.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.
